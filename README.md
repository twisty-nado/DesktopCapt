# DesktopCapt

Basically, this is a tool for capturing the ProgMan (yet that implementation didn't work so I just hid everything instead) to have a transparent image of your desktop icons.

I've tested it on Windows 7 and Windows 10. It should work on anything that can run .NET Framework 3.0.

## Usage

To capture an image, quite literally just press the Capture Desktop Icons.

#### Toggle this to make it transparent

<s>I will eventually in the future add saving to any directory, but right now, I'm lazy.</s>
### YOU CAN NOW SAVE ANYWHERE!

## <i><s>Limitations

I noticed something on Windows 7. It kept the start button.

However, anyone with a functional membrane would know to just remove it in something like <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>
</s></i>

### THIS IS FIXED NOW. THIS WAS WITH AN OLDER, DEV VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE

## Credits

I'd like to thank toehead2001 for their source code to <a href="https://github.com/toehead2001/aeroshot/">AeroShot</a>, and Cvolton for their source code to <a href="https://github.com/Cvolton/TransparentScreenshot/">TransparentScreenshot</a>.
I used the algorithm to remove the background from TransparentScreenshot

## FAQ

- How do you screenshot the taskbar?
Use AeroShot to screenshot it. Quite literally, click on it and press ALT + PrtSc

## Final notes

I haven't tested this program much, and I doubt I'll fix any bugs that occur. Feel free to fork this mess!
