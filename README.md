# DesktopCapt

Basically, this is a tool for capturing the ProgMan (yet that implementation didn't work so I just hid everything instead) to have a transparent image of your desktop icons.

### Limitations

I noticed something on Windows 7. It kept the start button.
<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Desktop_Icons_2025-12-01_20-19-36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a3c6456-3017-4224-988a-314c1ae02cde" />
However, anyone with a functional membrane would know to just remove it in something like <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>

### Credits

I'd like to thank toehead2001 for their source code to <a href="https://github.com/toehead2001/aeroshot/">AeroShot</a>, and Cvolton for their source code to <a href="https://github.com/Cvolton/TransparentScreenshot/">TransparentScreenshot</a>.
I used the algorithm to remove the background from TransparentScreenshot
